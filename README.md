`Group project` `Front-end`  `Back-end`  `Portfolio project`

NewsAgg is a web-based application that aggregates news articles from various sources and displays them in a single platform. With NewsAgg, users can easily browse and read articles from multiple news outlets without having to navigate to different websites or apps.

The application uses a combination of web scraping and API calls to collect articles from various sources, including mainstream news websites, blogs, and social media. It also provides a user-friendly interface for filtering articles by category, source, and keyword.

Whether you are interested in politics, entertainment, sports, or technology, NewsAgg makes it easy to stay up-to-date with the latest news from all over the world. With its robust search and filtering capabilities, users can easily find the articles that matter most to them.

NewsAgg is built using modern web development frameworks and is designed to be responsive and accessible on all devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

### The Story

The motivation behind NewsAgg was simple: to have all the available news in one place. As an avid news consumer, I found myself spending countless hours browsing different websites, social media feeds, and news apps to stay up-to-date with the latest happenings. It was a tedious and time-consuming task that often left me feeling overwhelmed and uninformed.

I realized that there had to be a better way to consume news, and that's when the idea for NewsAgg was born. I wanted to create a tool that would aggregate news from different sources and present it in an easy-to-digest format. With NewsAgg, users could access the latest news and events from different sources in one place, without having to navigate through multiple websites or apps.

### Technologies Employed

NewsAgg was built using the following technologies:

- HTML 5 & CSS 3 (Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap were employed for styling)
- JavaScript
- Python

HTML and CSS were used to create the user interface and design of NewsAgg, with Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap employed for styling. JavaScript was used for client-side scripting and to create dynamic interactions within the platform. Python was used for server-side scripting and to handle backend logic.

I also used the following tools and technologies:

- MySQL database
- NewsAPI
- Google OAuth API
- jQuery

The MySQL database was used to store and retrieve data related to users and their preferences. NewsAPI was used to aggregate news from various sources and present it to users in a unified format. Google OAuth API was employed to handle user authentication and secure login.

jQuery was used to enhance the user interface and provide dynamic and interactive features. Node.js and Express were used to build the server-side of the application and handle requests from clients.

Together, these technologies helped to create a powerful and user-friendly news aggregation platform that provides access to the latest news and events from different sources.
